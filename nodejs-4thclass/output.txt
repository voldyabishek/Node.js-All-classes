CONST FS = REQUIRE('FS');

IMPORT THE NODE.JS FILE SYSTEM MODULE TO WORK WITH FILES.
CONST READSTREAM = FS.CREATEREADSTREAM('INPUT.TXT', 'UTF-8');

CREATE A READABLE STREAM (READSTREAM) TO READ DATA FROM THE 'INPUT.TXT' FILE IN UTF-8 ENCODING.
CONST WRITESTREAM = FS.CREATEWRITESTREAM('OUTPUT.TXT', 'UTF-8');

CREATE A WRITABLE STREAM (WRITESTREAM) TO WRITE DATA TO THE 'OUTPUT.TXT' FILE IN UTF-8 ENCODING.
LET BUFFERDATA = '';

INITIALIZE AN EMPTY STRING (BUFFERDATA) TO STORE THE MODIFIED DATA.
READSTREAM.ON('DATA', (CHUNK) => { ... });

SET UP AN EVENT LISTENER FOR THE 'DATA' EVENT OF THE READABLE STREAM.
WHEN DATA IS RECEIVED (READ IN CHUNKS), THE PROVIDED CALLBACK FUNCTION IS EXECUTED.
CONST MODIFIEDCHUNK = CHUNK.TOSTRING().TOUPPERCASE();

CONVERT THE RECEIVED DATA CHUNK TO A STRING AND TRANSFORM IT TO UPPERCASE (MODIFY THE DATA).
BUFFERDATA += MODIFIEDCHUNK;

APPEND THE MODIFIED DATA CHUNK TO THE BUFFERDATA STRING.
READSTREAM.ON('END', () => { ... });

SET UP AN EVENT LISTENER FOR THE 'END' EVENT OF THE READABLE STREAM.
WHEN THE READABLE STREAM HAS FINISHED READING ALL DATA, THE PROVIDED CALLBACK FUNCTION IS EXECUTED.
WRITESTREAM.WRITE(BUFFERDATA);

WRITE THE MODIFIED DATA STORED IN THE BUFFERDATA STRING TO THE WRITABLE STREAM.
WRITESTREAM.END();

CLOSE THE WRITABLE STREAM.
WRITESTREAM.ON('FINISH', () => { ... });

SET UP AN EVENT LISTENER FOR THE 'FINISH' EVENT OF THE WRITABLE STREAM.
WHEN THE WRITABLE STREAM HAS FINISHED WRITING ALL DATA, THE PROVIDED CALLBACK FUNCTION IS EXECUTED, INDICATING THE WRITING PROCESS IS COMPLETE.
ERROR HANDLING:

READSTREAM.ON('ERROR', (ERR) => { ... }); HANDLES ERRORS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING READING.
WRITESTREAM.ON('ERROR', (ERR) => { ... }); HANDLES ERRORS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING WRITING.
THE CODE READS DATA FROM 'INPUT.TXT', CONVERTS IT TO UPPERCASE, AND WRITES THE MODIFIED DATA TO 'OUTPUT.TXT', ALL WHILE EFFICIENTLY HANDLING DATA USING STREAMS AND BUFFERING FOR DATA MANIPULATION. ERROR HANDLING ENSURES THAT ANY ISSUES DURING THE PROCESS ARE APPROPRIATELY MANAGED.




STREAMS ARE USED IN NODE.JS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENTS FOR SEVERAL IMPORTANT REASONS:

EFFICIENCY: STREAMS ALLOW YOU TO WORK WITH DATA IN A MORE MEMORY-EFFICIENT WAY. INSTEAD OF READING OR WRITING AN ENTIRE FILE OR DATASET INTO MEMORY ALL AT ONCE, YOU CAN PROCESS IT IN SMALLER, MANAGEABLE CHUNKS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL WHEN DEALING WITH LARGE FILES OR LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA, AS IT REDUCES THE MEMORY FOOTPRINT OF YOUR PROGRAM.

SPEED: STREAMING CAN BE FASTER THAN TRADITIONAL I/O OPERATIONS BECAUSE IT ENABLES PARALLEL PROCESSING. WHILE ONE CHUNK OF DATA IS BEING READ OR WRITTEN, OTHER PARTS OF YOUR PROGRAM CAN CONTINUE EXECUTING, LEADING TO BETTER OVERALL PERFORMANCE.

NON-BLOCKING: STREAMS ARE NON-BLOCKING, WHICH MEANS YOUR PROGRAM DOESN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN ENTIRE FILE TO BE READ OR WRITTEN BEFORE MOVING ON TO OTHER TASKS. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR APPLICATIONS THAT NEED TO REMAIN RESPONSIVE, SUCH AS WEB SERVERS HANDLING MULTIPLE CLIENT REQUESTS SIMULTANEOUSLY.

PIPING: STREAMS CAN BE EASILY CONNECTED OR "PIPED" TOGETHER. THIS MEANS YOU CAN TAKE THE OUTPUT OF ONE STREAM AND USE IT AS THE INPUT FOR ANOTHER, ALLOWING YOU TO CREATE COMPLEX DATA PROCESSING PIPELINES WITH MINIMAL CODE.

MODULARITY: STREAMS PROMOTE A MODULAR DESIGN. YOU CAN CREATE REUSABLE COMPONENTS THAT PROCESS DATA STREAMS INDEPENDENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MIGHT HAVE A STREAM THAT READS DATA FROM A NETWORK SOCKET, ANOTHER STREAM THAT PROCESSES AND FILTERS THE DATA, AND A FINAL STREAM THAT WRITES THE DATA TO A FILE. EACH COMPONENT CAN BE TESTED AND MAINTAINED SEPARATELY.

FLEXIBILITY: STREAMS ARE VERSATILE AND CAN WORK WITH VARIOUS DATA SOURCES AND DESTINATIONS. YOU CAN USE THEM TO READ FROM AND WRITE TO FILES, NETWORK SOCKETS, HTTP REQUESTS AND RESPONSES, AND MORE. THIS FLEXIBILITY MAKES THEM SUITABLE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS.

REAL-TIME PROCESSING: STREAMS ARE WELL-SUITED FOR REAL-TIME DATA PROCESSING SCENARIOS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN WEB APPLICATIONS, YOU CAN USE STREAMS TO HANDLE LIVE DATA FROM WEBCAMS, SENSORS, OR CHAT APPLICATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO STORE THE ENTIRE DATA STREAM IN MEMORY.

REDUCED LATENCY: STREAMS CAN HELP REDUCE DATA TRANSFER LATENCY. INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR ALL DATA TO BE AVAILABLE, YOU CAN START PROCESSING AND TRANSMITTING CHUNKS OF DATA AS SOON AS THEY ARE READY, WHICH CAN IMPROVE THE PERCEIVED SPEED OF YOUR APPLICATION.
